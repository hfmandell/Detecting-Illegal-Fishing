### Project Description
By ingesting [fishing vessel tracking data](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-training-data-v1), I will train a neural network to classify vessels and detect a variety of fishing events. The network will be fed [AIS](https://spire.com/wiki/ais-tracking-data-your-ultimate-guide/) (Automatic Identification System) data, which is a required tracking system that uses GPS sensors on ships, and potentially VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) data as well.

Above is an example of AIS data from a troller ship.



### Project Goals
1. Use Global Fishing Watch's dataset to train a model that can identify different types of fishing behavior
2. Apply the model to Global Fishing Watch's testing dataset to categorize fighing behaviors.
3. (Longer Term) Can we predict the fishing behaviors with less data? That is, in real time?
